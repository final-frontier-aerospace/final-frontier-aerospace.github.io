Monday we started our fall semester and are excited to start a new year of designing. Our website is getting a revamp in preparation for our 
online activities and meetings. Our team meetings will be online as much as possible, hosted on Zoom, (https://ksu.zoom.us/j/98631197829) every Monday at 6:30 PM. 

We'd like to take this time to thank all of our current [sponsors](https://ffaero.com/sponsors) that are sticking with us for another year.
Without their help, there would be no way we would be able to compete or do any of the things we do.
