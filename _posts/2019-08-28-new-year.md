Monday we voted on new officers and are getting ready to start a new year.
We've started redoing a lot of stuff on the website, some new organizational things, etc. and we're hoping for a great new year.

We'd like to take this time to thank all of our current [sponsors](https://ffaero.com/sponsors) that are sticking with us for another year.
Without their help, there would be no way we would be able to compete or do any of the things we do.
